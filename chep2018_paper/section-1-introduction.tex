Intro to working group - some history - refer to earlier papers.

Reminder WLCG MB agreed timelines for transition.

Since CHEP16 we have been:
a) Encouraging, helping and tracking transition
b) Tier 1 and LHCOPN tracking
c) Tier 2 tracking

Also, chasing any technical issues, e.g. dCache at KIT.

Working with experiments still very important - they define the requirements.

Also work on monitoring frameworks, dash boards etc (not us doing this - we track their progress).
Also other central services.

Then describe structure of rest of paper.
