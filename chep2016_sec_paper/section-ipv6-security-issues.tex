IPv6 Security issues

New features

Many more ICMP message types! Cannot filter all of them (MTU discovery has to work). Must filter some of them. RFC4890 gives advice

New methods for autoconfiguring addresses, routes, DNS. Good for the end-user. Must do something against rogue Router Advertisements (see RFC6104)

Longer IP addresses. Hey, everyone knows that. They may slow down brute force scans. But no bad guy is that crude...

Cannot fragment packets en-route.  Minimum MTU: 1280. But you can still hurt yourself and send small fragments if you wish. Some good news, at least

Not really a feature of IPv6 proper, but much of the network stack and application code is enticingly fresh!

Transitional technologies (e.g. tunnels) have intrinsic vulnerabilities but don't need to be there forever...


Business as usual

As long as all network monitoring and administration tools are up-to-date and (therefore) aware of IPv6.

Broadcasts and Multicasts are still there, with a vengeance.
Can still use IP headers for out-of-band communications.
Can still pollute Ethernet address discovery (ND instead of ARP).
Can still run a rogue DHCP server.
Can still try forging and injecting packets into the local network. 
Upper-layer protocols did not change!
