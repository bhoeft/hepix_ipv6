% Summary

In this paper, we have discussed some of the security concerns that arise from the deployment of the IPv6 networking protocols. In particular, we have presented our IPv6 security checklist for sysadmins and site networking/security teams at WLCG sites. We have also presented a checklist for WLCG/HEP application developers and software engineers. We welcome feedback from sites and
developers on the contents of these lists according to their experiences during the transition.  HEP IT support staff have spent many decades understanding and fixing security problems and concerns in the IPv4 world. We confidently predict that securing IPv6 will take an equally long time!
